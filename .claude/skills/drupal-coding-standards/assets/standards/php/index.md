The Drupal coding standards for PHP.

PHP standards are enforced using [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer). The rules used are from that project as well as the [Drupal coder project](https://drupal.org/project/coder) and [Slevomat](https://github.com/slevomat/coding-standard).
