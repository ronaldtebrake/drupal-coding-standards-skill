# Coding Standards

The Drupal coding standards apply to code within Drupal and its contributed modules. These standards are version-independent and "always-current".

All new code should follow the current standards, regardless of (core) version.

Existing code in older versions may be updated. For large code-bases (like Drupal core), updating the code of a previous version for the current standards may be too huge of a task.

Comments and names should use US English spelling.

Coding standard fixes are done by rule not individual files.

The video tutorial, [Understanding the Drupal Coding Standards](https://drupalize.me/videos/understanding-drupal-coding-standards?p=2012), explains the standards, why they are important, and how to use them.
